Semantic versioning is used to define an API version for when downstream users have to update interfaces 

Thus version x.y.z of the network is like this

  x - major version must be incremented if the NN inputs or outputs change, because this requires updates to downstream interfaces
  y - minor version should be incremented if the TGLF settings are changed in the training set (e.g. SAT1 or SAT2).
  z - patch version should be incremented if the training data / space, loss function, filters, or NN hyper-parameters are updated
